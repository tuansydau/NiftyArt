# artNftContracts


## Web Development
The E-commerce website was designed and implemented in Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The **Django** framework was used for the back-end portion of the site, and the **Boostrap** library was used for the front-end. Our goal with the website was to be able to display the art peices in full view on the front page and allow customers to:

* Easily view details on an art peice 
* Add it to their cart, 
* Check-out with Meta-Mask (a cryptocurrency payment app). 

The site also allows users to create an account to view their previously purchased peices.
