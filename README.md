## Web Development
This E-commerce website was designed and implemented in Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript by alborzdev. The **Django** framework was used for the back-end portion of the site, and the **Boostrap** library was used for the front-end. Our goal with the website was to be able to display the art peices in full view on the front page and allow customers to:

* Easily view details on an art peice 
* Add it to their cart
* Check-out with Meta-Mask (a cryptocurrency payment app). 

The site also allows users to create an account to view their previously purchased pieces.

#### alborzdev Insights: 
This was my first time developing a full website so I had to find a place where I could start. We first had a front page written in HTML before we quickly realized we would need an extensive back-end to run the website; that is where Django came in. I found an amazing tutorial on youtube made by Very Academy [1] (link to youtube channel), he provided an amazing, in depth tutorial on how to write an E-commerce back-end & front-end using Django and Boostrap [2] (link to tutorial playlist). I closely followed the tutorial minute by minute, coding everything from scratch alongside the video ensuring I was learning as much as possible. The code in our program closely ressembles the tutorial, while also being tweaked in many places as the tutorial was about designing a book store, while our website was an art gallery. Later in the tutorial I felt confident to make many changes to the code to make the website our own. These include the one time purchase of art peices, implementing purchasing using meta mask, front-end tweaks to ensure art would be displayed properly, and a few more tweaks here and there. I plan to use this website's back-end as something to look back on and resuse in future projects as it is an amazing base for any E-commerce store, and website in general.
