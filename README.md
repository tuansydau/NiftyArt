# artNftContracts


## Web Development
The E-commerce website was designed and imlpemented in Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The Django framework was used for the back-end portion of the site, and the Boostrap library was used for the front-end. Our goal with the website was to be able to display the art peices in full view on the front page and allow customers to easily view details on an art peice, add it to their cart, and check-out with Meta-Mask (a cryptocurrency payment app). The site also allows users to create an account to view their previously purchased peices.
